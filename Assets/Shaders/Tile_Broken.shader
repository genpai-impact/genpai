	Neon Lit Hexagons
	-----------------

	I needed a break from a few technical shaders I've beem hacking away at, so I finished an old 
	geometric example that'd been sitting on the blocks for a while.
	
	3D hexagon tech imagery is a bit of a cliche, but I've always been a fan. Most tend to be high 
	quality pathtraced renderings, but since this is a realtime raymarched example, I had to make 
	a lot of concessions. The glowing neon lights were inspired by some of Shau's examples, some
	online imagery, and practically half the demos out there. :)

	I tried to create the glowing effect without the use of a volumetric pass, but my eyes weren't
	accepting the results, which meant the observant people on here -- pretty much everyone -- would 
	notice immediately, so I put a relatively cheap one in. The improvements were immediate, but it
	was at the cost of rendering speed... I'm just hoping no one notices the lack of reflections from 
	the neon lights. :) I have a pretty quick laptop, but ever since the WebGL 2 update, it hasn't 
	enjoyed compiling extra passes, so reflections had to go. At a later stage, I might attempt to 
	fake them in some way.

	There are a couple of surface detail defines below that I had to leave out. I also came pretty 
	close to greebling the surfaces, but figured that might be overkill. In the end, I took the 
	"less is more" approach. However, I intend to put together a greebled surface pretty soon.
